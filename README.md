# Blackjack
## Purpose
This was a fun project assignment for a programming class in Spring 2018. The task was to create a functioning game of Blackjack in C++, with full logic for the dealer (hitting and staying according to the standard rules of Blackjack). 

The player can choose from 1 of 5 options; displaying the player/dealer's hand, hitting, staying, and exiting the game. The dealer will then continue to hit until their hand is at least 17, at which point they will stay, and the result of the game is determined.
## How to Run
Simply compile **Card.hpp, Card.cpp, Deck.hpp, Deck.cpp, Main.cpp, Player.hpp, and Player.cpp** using a standard C++ compiler such as G++, and run the output .exe file :)
